	Assignment:	mario.c --  Prints out a half-pyramid
	Author: 	Pascal Laurent

	Description:
	The program prints out a half-pyramid
	 of a specified height between 0 and 23.

 **************************************************************/

Specification:
==============

-- Write, in a file called mario.c, a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks.

-- To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. (The height of the half-pyramid pictured above happens to be 8.)

-- If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, you should re-prompt for the same again.

-- Then, generate (with the help of printf and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.

-- Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
