<strong>some</strong>
To figure out if ANY single value satisfies a condition in an array, we can use the some function. This will return true if ANY value passes a condition specified in the callback, and false if all values fail the condition.

<strong>every</strong>
To figure out if ALL values satisfy a condition in an array, we can use the every function. This will return true if ALL values pass a condition specified in the callback. If even one value fails the condition, every will return false.

<strong>find</strong>
find was added to JavaScript in ES2015 to make it easier to find an element in an array based on some condition. This iterator will return the first value in an array that satisfies a condition (an expression that returns true in the callback).

<strong>findIndex</strong>
Use the findIndex function to find the first index in an array that satisfies a condition (an expression that returns true in the callback).
